# Connect DB in Docker Postgres

This project is to connect local to Posgres in Docker container. I use Faker and random to generate test data and run a series of SQL queries to test againast the database. 


## How to Run it


### Step 1: Comfigure ODBC
When using Mac OS X, the installer will create a sample user DSN in odbc.ini in either of the following locations:
```
~/Library/ODBC/odbc.ini
~/.odbc.ini
```

You may configure your `.odbc.ini` file by using the following:
```
[ODBC Data Sources]
my_driver = postodbc

[ODBC]
Trace = 0

[my_driver]
Driver      = /usr/local/lib/psqlodbcw.so
ServerName  = localhost
Port        = 5432
Database    = banking_db
Username    = postgres
Password    = 12345
```

And configure your `odbcinst.ini` file by using the following:
```
[ODBC Drivers]
postodbc = Installed

[postodbc]
Description     = PostgreSQL ODBC driver
Driver          = /usr/local/lib/psqlodbcw.so
Setup           = /usr/local/lib/psqlodbcw.so
Debug           = 0
```


### Step 2: Set up local environment
Cd to your project directly, and create a virtual environment by using the following command:
```
$ virtualenv venv
```
and activate the virtual environment that you created:
```
$. ./venv/bin/activate
```
then you may install all dependencies using the following:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Step 3: Prepare Docker environment
First, pull postgres image from Docker hub by using
```
$ docker pull postgres:9.6
```
I use postgres version 9.6 here, but you may choose other versions. Depending on your needs, you may pull other images from Docker hub, for example, other images I pulled include python, busybox, etc.



### Step 4: Build and run Docker image 
In order to do that, you may simply run the setup.sh:
```
$ . ./setup.sh
```


### Step 5: Connect to Postgres in Docker and populate test data
In project folder, you may run the test.py file by using:

```
$ python test.py
```
This process include three tasks:
- connect to ​Postgres running in the docker via pyodbc​​
- populate banking_db with mock test data generated by Faker and Random
- run demonstration SQL queries


### Step 6: Check database 

After the database is successfully built, you may use the following command to enter the Docker container:
```
$ docker exec -it custom_psql_running /bin/sh
```

Then you may enter the database by using the following command:
```
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres
```

Till this step, you should be able to connect to the database that we created by using:
```
postgres=# \c banking_db;
```
Also take a look at the tables that we created earlier:
```
banking_db=# \dt;
```
You should be able to see all three tables listed, including customer, account, customer_account.

Then you may play around with the database with SQL queries, for example:
```
select * from customer limit 5;
```
This will give you the top 5 customer records in the database.
Have fun!
